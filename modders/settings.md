# Modifying the RemoteTech settings

{% include toc.html %}

RemoteTech has a configuration of default settings, such as the `EnableSignalDelay` flag or a `GroundStations` node of ground stations. These settings are loaded from RemoteTech's default-setting cfg file during Kerbal Space Program's startup screen.

If a player starts a new game from the main menu, RemoteTech executes a sequence of actions:

1. Probe KSP's `GameDatabase` to obtain a list of configurations contained the `RemoteTechSettings` node
2. Iterate through this list to find the configuration of `Default_Settings.cfg`
3. Load the configuration into the RemoteTech's internal settings
4. Check if there is the RemoteTech settings in the player's newly-created save
5. As they do not exist in the save, RemoteTech proceeds to begin its operations

However, if a player resumes an existing game, the RemoteTech settings should be present in the game save.

4. Check if there is the RemoteTech settings in the player's newly-created save
5. When the settings are found, RemoteTech replaces the default values in its internal settings with the save values
6. RemoteTech proceeds to begin its operations

## Full settings

In the `GameData/RemoteTech/Default_Settings.cfg` file, all of the RemoteTech settings are stored inside a root node, `RemoteTechSettings`. See this [page](http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/guide/settings/) for the most of the settings.

### Ground stations

The `GroundStations` node controls the number, range, and placement of satellite uplink stations. Each `STATION{}` block represents a station. By default, there is a single ground station, coinciding with the Tracking Station of the Kerbal Space Center.

Each `STATION{}` block needs the following fields:

`Guid`
: A unique idenfier for the station. **Must** be unique, or your network will exhibit undefined behavior. If you need a way to generate new guids, try [random.org](http://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=16&format=h).

`Name`
: The name that a player see in-game.

`Latitude`, `Longitude`
: The position of the station on the planet's surface in degrees north and degrees east, respectively.

`Height`
: The station's altitude above sea level, in meters.

`Body`
: The internal ID number of the planet on which the station is located. You can find a list of ID numbers for stock Kerbal Space Program [here](https://github.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/blob/master/src/FlightGlobals.cs#L72). If you are playing with Real Solar System or other planet packs, edit this value with caution.

`MarkColor` (RGBÎ± quadruplet) (default = Red, fully opaque)
: The color in which the ground station will be drawn as a solid circle on the map view and tracking station.

`Antennas`
: This block should contain a single `ANTENNA` block, which itself should contain a single `Omni` field. The value of the field is the antenna range in meters. Except for the three-level `UpgradeableOmni` field, the other fields are currently unused.

## Upgrading your RemoteTech tweaks

## Examples of MM patches

Assumed that you are familiar with the Module Manager's [Handbook](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager/wiki/Module-Manager-Handbook), a number of examples are provided to show how you could modify one or more settings through a patch.

### Edit a setting

### Add one or more ground stations

### Precedence order of third-party RemoteTech patches
