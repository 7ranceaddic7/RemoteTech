##Introduction to RemoteTech
RemoteTech is a modification for Squad's 'Kerbal Space Program' which overhauls the unmanned space program. It does this by requiring unmanned vessels have a connection to Kerbal Space Center (KSC) to be able to be controlled. This adds a new layer of difficulty that compensates for the lack of live crewmembers.

##Overview of mechanics

###Antennas
Using antennas, it is now possible to set up satellite networks to route your control input. There are two classes of antennas: 'Dishes' and 'Omnidirectionals'.

####Dishes
Dishes are antennas that must be instructed what direction to point at. They do not physically point at something; it is as simple as selecting a target from a list. Dishes tend to be used for long range communication and come with a cone of vision (getting smaller as range gets bigger). If the dish is pointed at a planet or moon, anything inside this cone can achieve a stable connection with the dish.

####Omnidirectionals
Omni antennas radiate in every direction equally, and as such do not require you to target them at anything. A consequence is that they are limited to shorter ranges.

###Signal Delay
To comply with Kerbal law, RemoteTech is required to delay your control input so that signalling does not exceed the 'speed of light' (pfft, what a silly law). If you are aware of the consequences of breaking the law (or like being a rebel), you are free to turn this off in the settings file.

###Connections
A 'working connection' is defined as a command center being able to send control input to its destination and back. Connections between neighbouring satellites are referred to as 'links'. To have a link between two satellites, it is required that both satellites can transmit a signal to the other independently. For point A to transmit with a dish, the dish would need to be set to target point B, point B would need to be within range of A's dish, and there would need to be no planets or moons blocking the line of sight between point A and point B. Since omni antennas are never targeted, they merely need to have point B within range and a clear line of sight. Note that point B also has to pass these criteria (many new players forget that *both* points must be in range of *each others'* antennas). You have a connection when there is a sequence of links between a command center and the destination.

If there are multiple ways to get a working connection (e.g., relaying through different satellites), RemoteTech will automatically pick the shortest path with the smallest signal delay. This won't always be the path with the fewest links.

**Example:** this probe in low Munar orbit can't link to KSP because the probe is on the far side of the Mun. However, it can link to a relay satellite in polar orbit. The relay also can't link to KSP, because KSP is on the other side of the planet. However, it can link to any of several communications satellites orbiting Kerbin (for clarity, only the best connection is shown). One of these satellites can link to KSP (shown by the red dot). Therefore, the probe has a working connection with KSP, as relayed by the two intermediate satellites, even though there are nearly 1600 km of solid rock blocking a direct transmission.

###Signal Processors
Signal Processors are any part that can recieve commands over a working connection, including all stock probe cores. You will only be able to control a signal processor as long as you have a working connection, and by default you will be subject to [signal delay](#signal_delay). Signal processors also include a *Flight Computer* that can be used to schedule actions ahead of time, and that can carry out basic tasks during a gap in communications.

###Command Stations
For those extra long distance missions, it is possible to set up a team of Kerbals to act as a local command center. This Command Station can not process science, a connection to KSC will still be required for that. However, the Command Station allows you to work without the signal delay to Kerbin, which might otherwise climb up to several minutes. Command Stations require a special probe part and a minimum number of kerbals to operate. Consult your VAB technicians for more information.

###Science Transmissions
Transmitting science back to KSC now requires you have a working connection back to KSC. Any other source of control, such as a crew pod or a working connection to a command station, does not count.
